st.markdown("""
- Each player gets 10 cards and there's one center card.
- The active player selects cards from their hand and clicks "Ready".
- The opponent then guesses if the selected cards match the center card's suit.
- If the guess is wrong, the guessing player faces the Mine Challenge.
- Each player starts with their own set of 6 diamonds for the Mine Challenge.
- If you click a safe diamond, it is removed from your set and the round immediately ends as safe.
- If you click the lose diamond, you lose the game and return to the start screen.
- You also win if you empty your hand of cards.
